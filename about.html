    <h2 class="abtheader">-  Bio/Vision  -</h2>
    <p> From a young age, I have always enjoyed looking at maps and believe that geography is under appreciated in our world today. Many people do not realize that getting a degree in geography is an option, or that if one does so it is not worth anything. I beg to differ. When I found out that Virginia Tech offered geography as a major, I was thrilled and ready to show people geography mattered. I took AP Human Geography in high school which really increased my existing interest in maps as well as viewing things in a spatial context. I believe viewing problems spatially offers a new perspective and allows one to truly visualize what is going on. I am a person with many interests such as landscaping, art, running, and animals. It is rare when I cannot think of a way GIS could be used to expand my passions. Perhaps I can make a smaller site map for somebody’s yard I am redoing, use a base map to digitize all the features, and then symbolize it using a special vegetation project style in ArcPro. Maybe I can track all the black bear sightings in a county and effectively visualize it on a map, or maybe even produce some trail maps for hikers and runners. I have fortunately gotten the opportunity to learn how to make all these scenarios come true during my time at Virginia Tech as a geography major through covering many topics. As an undergraduate, I learned human geography, how cities developed over time and why they are designed the way they are, the evolution of map making, and most heavily some GIS skills. I first wanted to double major in urban planning and geography, but later decided to have one major and two minors: GIS and EPP (Environmental Policy and Planning). Pursing a GIS minor while already having a geography major meant extra requirements, so I was forced to dive a little deeper into the GIS curriculum than the average student. I have long been interested in urban life and how we can improve it. That is why I chose EPP as a second minor, I figured it paired well with my other studies and would require some map making as well! This boded well for me at my summer internship as a GIS Technician where I saw how essential GIS is in city planning and small governments.</p>
    <p>My goal is simple, to use my GIS and cartographic knowledge to help others. If my career can involve producing maps, I know I can be happy. I want to be one who knows how to make the most effective visualizations possible and lead by example through getting the job done right when it comes to map making. With GIS growing like it never has before, more people are using the technology for their business, academic, and professional needs. More people making maps means more people making errors while making maps. While the growth of GIS is incredible, a lot of people are just taught how to click the buttons, not necessarily how to make maps appear well. For example, many people may make a simple choropleth map of population for the contiguous U.S. and just assume California, New York, and Illinois are where all the people are. However, perhaps if geography were taught more in schools and new map users learned different techniques, they would learn how to make that same map with normalized data, better classes, and erased county boundaries to better understand population density. Maybe then they could see that while Illinois does have a lot of people overall, they are mostly in Chicago and that overall, it is a rural state. I want to fix common misunderstandings such as this, be part of the solution, and find even better ways to visualize data. I see a great need for increased cartographic knowledge in our society and would love to be a part of its advancement.</p>
    <h2 class="abtheader">-  Experience  -</h2>
    <p>This past spring graduated from Virginia Tech with a B.A. in Geography, as well as minors in GIS and EPP. I have taken many classes in GIS, the most notable being Modeling in GIS, Cartography, Spatial Analysis, Land Change Modeling, and Geovisualization. Earlier on in my academic career, much time was spent learning the fundamentals of ArcMap as well as geography on a broader scale. There was a heavy focus on why things happen where they do and emphasizing Tobler’s first law of geography regarding how things closer together are more related. Later on, I became more interested in visualizing things, all while learning more tools and techniques. Simply put, I love making good maps. Cartography was without a doubt my favorite class I took in college. Cartography taught me things I never really knew about such as how important the placement of map elements are, techniques like visual contrast, or the importance of projecting my data. Additionally, I took Esri’s free MOOC (Massive Online Open Course) on cartography earlier this summer. The class taught me many great map making tips, advanced symbology techniques, and some neat history about cartography and how humans have visualized information over time. Most recently, I have completed the course Graphic Design in Cartography and as a graduate student at University of Wisconsin Madison. This class advanced my map making skills even further and introduced me to software like Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, MapBox, and even how to make this website using HTML and CSS! I reinvented my idea behind the process of forming maps to view maps as if they were telling a story, and that learned skills obtained as a cartographer can apply to more than just map making, like making longform infographics. </p>
    <p>I have also gained real world experience as a GIS Technician intern at a Gaithersburg City Hall in Maryland and a geocoder for the DMV with an ongoing project with Virginia Tech. My main task as an intern was to create mosaic datasets out of aerial imagery from different years representing the area of the city. This project made it easy to visualize urban development over time. When I began this task, I knew little more than the fact that the ArcMap tool mosaic meant stitching images together. I was given an overall task, but not a lot of information on how to do it. That however was the point! I was supposed to learn on my own, something I enjoy doing and something I get to experience a lot when making maps. I learned all the parameters behind each tool used in making mosaic datasets, the best ones to use, and the order in which they should be used. I had to deal with special cases of no data values, learn how to remove them so there were no black smudges on the final product (usually from older aerial imagery), and learn how to export the final product. Aside from creating mosaic datasets, I was involved in a few data editing projects. I georeferenced plats of land for the city and updated road centerline attributes such as the conditions of street signs, traffic lights, and pavement striping. Digitizing land easements from very confusing overlapping survey drawings was one of my final tasks, and it required a lot of attention to detail, as did my other projects. I currently work as a geocoder for the Virginia DMV through an ongoing project the state has with Virginia Tech. In this job as well, attention to detail is crucial. There are very specific criteria for one of four categories that vehicle crashes may be classified and documented as, that is either parking lot, address, interstate, or intersection. Interpreting the report and map given by the police are an integral part of this. As the geocoder, my job is to use all the information to accurately place a GPS point at the location of the crash and then classify it as one of the four categories based on criteria met at that location. I believe attention to detail is one of the most important skills to develop as a cartographer, and one I have had the opportunity to develop and improve upon over time. Detail on a map is so important so that there are no mistakes in the final product. Quality checking my work as a GIS Technician consisted of me going over a grid of the city and reviewing my work in each square before submitting my task. I have adopted this technique when making final map products. </p>
