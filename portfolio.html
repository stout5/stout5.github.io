        <h2 class="Project">-  Bike Map  -</h2>
        <h3 class="italics">Summary</h3>
        <p>I made this map in my Graphic Design in Cartography class at University of Wisconsin Madison. In this assignment, I was a hypothetical cartographer tasked with making a map of a long 21-day bike race. Each day’s starting and stopping point had to be clear and each day had to cover roughly 100 miles. The route was also required to go through populated cities, change frequently in elevation, and have a focus on natural features. That is why you will see plateaus, mountain ranges, rivers, lakes, and peaks labeled on this map. National Forests are also outlined in lighter green (much easier to see via the hyper link to the full sized zoomable map). Landcover is shown on this map with mainly farmland (yellow), forest (green), and urban areas (grey). Hill shading is shown in the mountainous areas to give the map a more real feel, this was done using photoshop. This project challenged me a lot, it was difficult to place so many labels all with different levels of significance on the map. It also expanded my skills from typically just using ArcPro, to incorporating Adobe Photoshop, and Illustrator for my final product. </p>

        <h2 class="Project">-  County Map  -</h2>
        <h3 class="italics">Summary</h3>
        <p>This detailed map of Frederick County, MD was my final project for my cartography class as an undergraduate at Virginia Tech. The goal of the assignment was to make a recreational map of a county of our choice. My group chose Frederick County, MD because of it’s extensive civil war history, many historical sites such as Camp David, and hiking trails. Details about historical sights, trails, campgrounds, and parks can be found in the amenities chart and recreational guide (see hyper link “Frederick County Recreational Guide”). This county map also displays towns throughout the county, bodies of water, and major roads. It is also highly recommended to click on the link to the full sized zoomable map to get the full experience! </p>

        <h2 class="Project">-  Longform Infographic  -</h2>
        <h3 class="italics">Summary</h3>
        <p>Like the first piece of work displayed on this page, this infographic on obesity in America was also from my Graphic Design in Cartography class as a graduate student. This was the first project of it's kind to me, maps were certainly involved, but so was a whole lot more. Maps were originally produced in ArcPro and then loaded into Adobe Illustrator which is where I did most of my work. This assignment challenged me to tell a story through a longform infographic, not just a map. Typography was key, and consistent colors for variables were important to maintain the viewer’s attention and understanding that a certain color meant a certain variable. This project also challenged me to make a bivariate choropleth map, something I had never done before. Make sure you exercise if able and spread the word about healthy eating habits!  </p>
