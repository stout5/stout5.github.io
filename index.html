         <p>I am Jesse Stout, a 22-year-old freelance cartographer from Silver Spring, MD with a strong passion for map making. Growing up, I always loved maps. I drew maps of my neighborhood, tried to memorize the outline of every state, and was always studying atlases. When I realized majoring in Geography was an option, I was ecstatic and knew it was the choice for me. Cartography is a passion for me, there is a need for greater cartographic education in America and believe it or not a lot of people need maps! I can almost always find a way to incorporate maps into my other passions, and I hope to do the same for other people and their passions! I have learend a lot about maps as an undergraduate, including taking MOOCs outside of any formal college, but want to soak up as much as I can on map making which is why I am currently pursuing my masters in GIS and Cartography at University of Wisconsin Madison! Please email or call with any projects I can do for you and check out the "About" tab for more information on me!</p>
